The party is named after uMkhonto we Sizwe (also shortened to MK), the paramilitary wing of the African National Congress (ANC) during apartheid. However, the ANC has threatened legal action over the usage of the name,[13] and the formation has been criticised by original MK veterans.[14]\\n\\nThe party rose to prominence in December 2023, when former president Jacob Zuma announced that, while planning to remain a lifelong member of the ANC, he would not be campaigning for the ANC in the 2024 South African general election, and would instead be voting for MK.[15] He stated that \"I cannot and will not\" campaign for the ANC of current president Cyril Ramaphosa, Zuma\\'s successor, and that to do so would be a \"betrayal\".[16][17]\\n\\nIdeology[edit]\\n\\nThe party has been described as populist and \"anti-foreigner\".[18] Voice of America called it a \"radical left-wing party\",[19] while Al Jazeera described it as socialist.[20] Nonetheless, it has supported some socially conservative policies including the repeal of laws legalising same-sex marriage.[21] However, the party has also been described as being centred entirely around former President Jacob Zuma, without a distinct ideology or character.[22]\\n\\nSupport[edit] date: 09 May 2024\\n , name of document: Wikipedia^^20240509^^uMkhonto we Sizwe.html, source: https://document_root_url/Wikipedia%5E%5E20240509%5E%5EuMkhonto%20we%20Sizwe.html', \"issues that are contained in our manifesto, Priority #4, Investing in our People. Corporate parks. Thank you very much. Good morning to members of the panel, members of the media and all colleagues here present. As you would know, two weeks ago the ANC launched its manifesto. At the My Family Rally that took place at Moses Mapita Stadium. We would like to thank all those comrades and members of the public that joined us. As we launched our manifesto and indeed launched our campaign for the 2024 national and provincial elections. We do not take for granted the efforts made by people. To join us. And to hear the message from the president of our commitments. In the next elections. But this was preceded a few months ago. By a process with which we engage with the public in relation to an evaluation of our implementation of the manifesto of the current administration. Went throughout the length and breadth of our country, talking to the people of this country about. How far we've come, the work that has been done, what challenges there might have been and how indeed would meet to improve on that. Reminiscing with Reminiscent about the groundbreaking announcements made by President Nelson Mandela in 1994. To implement the reconstruction and development program. These initiatives included providing free health care for pregnant women and children under 6. Offering free housing for the impoverished and the extensive roll out of water, sanitation, electricity to those previously disadvantaged. Our efforts have encompassed the promotion and protection of various groups, such as workers, women, the youth, people with disabilities. An LGBTQI plus community and senior citizens and cutting the Bill of Rights in our Constitution. The 2024 manifesto builds on the achievements of the past 30 years of democracy to tackle numerous challenges that persist despite these successes. Consequently, the 2024 Manifesto aims to consolidate the democratic gains since 1994, underscoring our continuous commitment to investing in our people and ensuring their well-being and prosperity. date: 18 March 2024\\n , name of document: MyANC^^20240318^^WATCH ANC briefs members of the media on Priority Four of the Election Manifesto - ANCs Plan.txt, source: https://document_root_url/MyANC%5E%5E20240318%5E%5EWATCH%20ANC%20briefs%20members%20of%20the%20media%20on%20Priority%20Four%20of%20the%20Election%20Manifesto%20-%20ANCs%20Plan.txt\"]\n",

Corporate parks. Thank you very much. Good morning to members of the panel, members of the media and all colleagues here present. As you would know, two weeks ago the ANC launched its manifesto. At the My Family Rally that took place at Moses Mapita Stadium. We would like to thank all those comrades and members of the public that joined us. As we launched our manifesto and indeed launched our campaign for the 2024 national and provincial elections. We do not take for granted the efforts made by people. To join us. And to hear the message from the president of our commitments. In the next elections. But this was preceded a few months ago. By a process with which we engage with the public in relation to an evaluation of our implementation of the manifesto of the current administration. Went throughout the length and breadth of our country, talking to the people of this country about. How far we\\'ve come, the work that has been done, what challenges there might have been and how indeed would meet to improve on that. Reminiscing with Reminiscent about the groundbreaking announcements made by President Nelson Mandela in 1994. To implement the reconstruction and development program. These initiatives included providing free health care for pregnant women and children under 6. Offering free housing for the impoverished and the extensive roll out of water, sanitation, electricity to those previously disadvantaged. Our efforts have encompassed the promotion and protection of various groups, such as workers, women, the youth, people with disabilities. An LGBTQI plus community and senior citizens and cutting the Bill of Rights in our Constitution. The 2024 manifesto builds on the achievements of the past 30 years of democracy to tackle numerous challenges that persist despite these successes. Consequently, the 2024 Manifesto aims to consolidate the democratic gains since 1994, underscoring our continuous commitment to investing in our people and ensuring their well-being and prosperity. date: 18 March 2024\\n , name of document: MyANC^^20240318^^WATCH ANC briefs members of the media on Priority Four of the Election Manifesto - ANCs Plan.txt, source: https://document_root_url/MyANC%5E%5E20240318%5E%5EWATCH%20ANC%20briefs%20members%20of%20the%20media%20on%20Priority%20Four%20of%20the%20Election%20Manifesto%20-%20ANCs%20Plan.txt'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='The People’s Manifesto Booklet - 20 January 2024\\nFOR THE PEOPLE\\nBY THE PEOPLERISE Mzansi will pursue five overarching economic objectives.\\n35\\nRepair government finances to protect the social \\nwage and invest in the economy.

Corporate parks. Thank you very much. Good morning to members of the panel, members of the media and all colleagues here present. As you would know, two weeks ago the ANC launched its manifesto. At the My Family Rally that took place at Moses Mapita Stadium. We would like to thank all those comrades and members of the public that joined us. As we launched our manifesto and indeed launched our campaign for the 2024 national and provincial elections. We do not take for granted the efforts made by people. To join us. And to hear the message from the president of our commitments. In the next elections. But this was preceded a few months ago. By a process with which we engage with the public in relation to an evaluation of our implementation of the manifesto of the current administration. Went throughout the length and breadth of our country, talking to the people of this country about. How far we've come, the work that has been done, what challenges there might have been and how indeed would meet to improve on that. Reminiscing with Reminiscent about the groundbreaking announcements made by President Nelson Mandela in 1994. To implement the reconstruction and development program. These initiatives included providing free health care for pregnant women and children under 6. Offering free housing for the impoverished and the extensive roll out of water, sanitation, electricity to those previously disadvantaged. Our efforts have encompassed the promotion and protection of various groups, such as workers, women, the youth, people with disabilities. An LGBTQI plus community and senior citizens and cutting the Bill of Rights in our Constitution. The 2024 manifesto builds on the achievements of the past 30 years of democracy to tackle numerous challenges that persist despite these successes. Consequently, the 2024 Manifesto aims to consolidate the democratic gains since 1994, underscoring our continuous commitment to investing in our people and ensuring their well-being and prosperity. date: 18 March 2024\\n , name of document: MyANC^^20240318^^WATCH ANC briefs members of the media on Priority Four of the Election Manifesto - ANCs Plan.txt, source: https://document_root_url/MyANC%5E%5E20240318%5E%5EWATCH%20ANC%20briefs%20members%20of%20the%20media%20on%20Priority%20Four%20of%20the%20Election%20Manifesto%20-%20ANCs%20Plan.txt\",\n",

      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "Mkhonto Wesizwe, abbreviated as MK, is a newly established left-wing populist political party in South Africa, founded in December 2023. The party's name, which translates to \"Spear of the Nation,\" is derived from the paramilitary wing of the African National Congress (ANC) that fought against apartheid. The emergence of MK has been marked by significant political events, including former President Jacob Zuma's announcement that he would not support the ANC in the upcoming 2024 elections but instead endorse MK. This shift has raised questions about the party's policies and its approach to various critical issues facing South Africa today. As the 2024 elections approach, MK's manifesto outlines its strategies for addressing economic challenges, education, healthcare, land reform, and social justice, reflecting its commitment to the South African populace.\n",
